### Installation
Just clone the repository, run `npm install` to install all node dependencies, then run `npm run dev` to start the application.

### Pull requests
Please apply the naming convention when you create a branch:
- Create your branch from `develop`
- For new feature, name your branch as `feature/{your-feature-name}`
- For bug fix, name your branch as `fix/issue-{issue-number}` or `fix/{whatever-you-fixed}`
- I'm using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) for all my commits, so please make sure to use it when you commit anything

Use `develop` branch as target branch for your pull requests. To contribute properly, try to have as few commits as possible, you can use `git rebase` to help you group your commits.

**⚠️ Any pull request that not respects contribution rules will be closed**
